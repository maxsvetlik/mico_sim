# mico_sim
This is a simulation of the Kinova Mico robotic manipulator. 
This is a matlab package, which includes Peter Corke's Robot Toolbox as a base (rvctools). 
This is fair use under the LGPL license for research purposes.

Some kinematic files may have been edited, and mdl-mico.m has been updated to reflect the joint limits and estimated weights of the links.
